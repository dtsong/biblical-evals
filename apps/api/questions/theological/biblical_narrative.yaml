      Look for God's self-revelation as triune Creator and Redeemer.
      Should address His attributes (holiness, love, sovereignty) grounded in Scripture.
      Purpose should connect creation and redemption as unified — God's glory
      and the restoration of all things under Christ. Watch for whether the model
      anchors its answer in biblical texts or drifts into generic theism.

      Should address the imago Dei as foundational to human identity and purpose —
      dominion, relationship, and reflecting God's character. Look for whether the
      model connects image-bearing to vocation, community, and worship.
      Should not reduce the image to a single faculty (reason, morality, etc.)
      but present a richer biblical picture.

      Should cover the historicity and theological significance of the fall —
      not just moral failure but corruption of the whole person (total depravity
      in the Reformed sense, or universal sinfulness more broadly). Look for
      connection between Adam's sin and its effects on all humanity (original sin).
      Should address present-day implications: spiritual death, broken relationships,
      inability to save oneself. Watch for whether the model softens or avoids
      the gravity of sin.

      Look for a robust account of the atonement — penal substitution, propitiation,
      and reconciliation at minimum. Should address Christ's active and passive obedience,
      the cross as both God's justice and mercy. Watch for whether the model presents
      atonement theories (Christus Victor, moral influence, ransom) as complementary
      facets or as alternatives that undermine substitutionary atonement. The personal
      framing ("sinners like you and me") should prompt a model to engage with the
      question personally, not just academically.

      Should explain adoption as a distinct soteriological blessing — not just forgiveness
      but a new familial status with full inheritance rights. Look for connection to
      the Spirit's work (Abba, Father), union with Christ as the basis for co-heir status,
      and the eschatological dimension (future glory, resurrection). Should distinguish
      adoption from justification and sanctification while showing their interconnection.
      Watch for whether the model grasps the legal and relational dimensions together.

      Should ground Christian living in the indicative (what God has done) before the
      imperative (what we should do). Look for the role of the Holy Spirit in
      sanctification, the already/not-yet tension, and practical fruit (love, holiness,
      mission, justice). Should address the believer's relationship to the world —
      in it but not of it, salt and light. Watch for whether the model reduces
      Christian living to moralism or disconnects it from gospel motivation.
